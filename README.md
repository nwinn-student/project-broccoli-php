## How to Test
First you would need a way to use PHP and SQL, I recommend [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html).

Upon downloading XAMPP, you can open up "xampp-control" and click "Start" for both Apache and MySQL.

You can then move the "project-broccoli-php" folder into "xampp/htdocs".

You can now go to your favorite search engine and type in "localhost/project-broccoli-php" and navigate from there, clicking on whichever project you want.

For SQL related projects, I would recommend downloading [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/) or another Database tool.
